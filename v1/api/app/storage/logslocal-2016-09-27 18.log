  'shortdescription' => '<span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size: 15pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Optimization can be viewed as a process that searches methodically for better answers,<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">better solutions, or better designs that a human being may not be able to find through<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">experience, intuition, or courageous trial-and-error. Optimization can be defined as the art<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">of making things better. Interestingly, optimization very often does not simply allow us to<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">do something better, but it may also make it possible to do something that we did not<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">otherwise know how to do. To take full advantage of the power of optimization in<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">practice, there is no choice but to use a computer.<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">The study of optimization typically takes a theoretical and/or computational approach.<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">The theoretical approach is highly useful when the objective is to develop new<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">optimization methods or to assess how the current methods work [<span style="font-size: 15pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">1<span style="font-size: 15pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">]. Additionally, the<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">study of optimization often focuses on the understanding of various search algorithms for<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">optimization. A book by Reklaitis and co-authors [<span style="font-size: 15pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">2<span style="font-size: 15pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">] is an example of methods-based<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">optimization presentation. While these books play an important role in the general study<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">of optimization, we pursue a different approach. The objective of this book takes on a<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">practical perspective. The current interest is in the immediate ability to apply optimization<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">in practice. In order to reach this objective, and to have the ability to apply optimization to<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">real world problems, we use the approach that is almost always required in the application<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">of optimization. We use the power of the computer, in conjunction with the study of<br><span style="font-size: 15pt;">different important practical aspects of optimization.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br style="line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;"></span></span></span></span></span>
