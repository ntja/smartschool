  'shortdescription' => '<span style="font-family: TimesLTStd-Roman; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 18px;">In this book we deal with certain mathematical models. This opening chapter, however, is a<br>nontechnical introduction, designed to provide background and motivation. In particular, we<br>are concerned with models used by actuaries, so we might first try to describe exactly what it<br>is that actuaries do. This can be difficult, because a typical actuary is concerned with many<br>issues, but we can identify two major themes dealt with by this profession.<br>The first is </span><span style="font-family: TimesLTStd-Italic;"><span style="font-size: 18px;"><i>risk</i><span style="font-family: TimesLTStd-Roman;">, a word that itself can be defined in different ways. A commonly accepted<br>definition in our context is that risk is the possibility that <span style="font-family: TimesLTStd-Italic;"><i>something bad </i><span style="font-family: TimesLTStd-Roman;">happens. Of course,<br>many bad things can happen, but in particular we are interested in occurrences that result<br>in <span style="font-family: TimesLTStd-Italic;"><i>financial loss</i><span style="font-family: TimesLTStd-Roman;">. A person dies, depriving family of earned income or business partners of<br>expertise. Someone becomes ill, necessitating large medical expenses. A home is destroyed<br>by fire or an automobile is damaged in an accident. No matter what precautions you take,<br>you cannot rid yourself completely of the possibility of such unfortunate events, but what you<br>can do is take steps to mitigate the financial loss involved. One of the most commonly used<br>measures is to purchase insurance.<br>Insurance involves a sharing or pooling of risks among a large group of people. The origins<br>go back many years and can be traced to members of a community helping out others who<br>suffered loss in some form or other. For example, people would help out neighbours who had<br>suffered a death or illness in the family. While such aid was in many cases no doubt due to<br>altruistic feelings, there was also a motivation of self-interest. You should be prepared to help<br>out a neighbour who suffered some calamity, since you or your family could similarly be<br>aided by others when you required such assistance. This eventually became more formalized,<br>giving rise to the insurance companies we know today.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br style="line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;"></span></span>
