<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">That might sounda bit fanciful, but MongoDB promises to help you accomplish all these things (and more). MongoDB (derived from the word humongous) is a relatively new breed of database that has no concept of tables, schemas, SQL, or rows. It doesn&rsquo;t have transactions, ACID compliance, joins, foreign keys, or many of the other features that tend to cause headaches in the early hours of the morning. In short, MongoDB is a very different database than you&rsquo;re probably used to, especially if you&rsquo;ve used a relational database management system (RDBMS) in the past. In fact, you might even be shaking your head in wonder at the lack of so-called &ldquo;standard&rdquo; features.</span></span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Fear not! In this course, you will learn about MongoDB&rsquo;s background and guiding principles, and why the MongoDB team made the design decisions that it did. We&rsquo;ll also take a whistle-stop tour of MongoDB&rsquo;s feature list, providing just enough detail to ensure that you&rsquo;ll be completely hooked on this topic for the rest of the course.</span></span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">We&rsquo;ll start by looking at the philosophy and ideas behind the creation of MongoDB, as well as some of the interesting and somewhat controversial design decisions. We&rsquo;ll explore the concept of document-oriented databases, how they fit together, and what their strengths and weaknesses are. We&rsquo;ll also explore JSON and examine how it applies to MongoDB. To wrap things up, we&rsquo;ll step through some of the notable features of MongoDB.</span></span></h3>
