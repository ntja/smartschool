Its ability to act as a scripting language for quick prototype building and its sophisticated language constructs for full-fledged software development combined with its fantastic library support for numeric computations has led to its current popularity among data scientists and the general scientific programming community.</span><br />
<span style="font-size:14px;">This course brings the art of data science with power Python programming to the readers and helps them master the concepts of data science. Knowledge of Python is not mandatory to follow this book. Non-Python programmers can refer to the first chapter, which introduces the Python data structures and function programming concepts.</span></p>
